# Quarto-Azure-Pipeline

If your organization uses Azure DevOps instead of GitHub for storing repositories,
you might need to setup a CI pipeline for automatically build and publish Quarto projects
using the Azure tools.

This repository stores an `azure-pipelines.yml` example that you can use to setup a simple
CI pipeline for your Quarto projects hosted on Azure DevOps, using
[Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/pipelines)
and [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/static).
